                Student Life

                Student life is the happiest period in the life of a person. It is a life, free from all anxieties of
                the tough world. The mind of the student is full of noble ideas and his eyes are full of

                His studies are his preparation for the coming struggle of life.</p>
            <p> If properly utilized, student life lays
                the foundation of future its success and achievements. If misused, defeat is sure however earned may out
                future efforts

                Student life is the most crucial period in the life of a person. </p>
            <p>Although there are no worldly cares to
                worry about the time, the period is very important for the student himself, for he has to be up and
                doing in the acquisition of knowledge in the formation of his character and in making contact with the
                world about him. The impressions he will gather at this period will determine his future conduct. The
                taste he will develop in student life will influence his behaviour towards other people throughout his
                future career. It is therefore necessary that a right and proper use of the period is made with the
                utmost care.</p>
            <p>Student life is the period of education. Education is the all round development of an individual into a
                useful member of society. We must see that student life is full-filling this aim. The success or failure
                of student-life can be judged by the students life. Unfortunately for us, student life in our country is
                not receiving the right amount of attention that it deserves. We hope things will take proper shape now.

            <p> A journey is an exciting experience to everybody. It provides a student with a relief from the routine
                works. So, a journey is more attractive to a student.A journey by train is especially very pleasant and
                enjoyable to me. A few days ago I made a journey by train from Dhaka to Chittagong.</p>
            <p> Occasion: During the last vacation one of my friends requested me to attend his sisterâ€™s marriage
                ceremony at Chittagong. Our relation is so deep that I could not regret the invitation . On top of that,
                it was an opportunity to make a train journey. So, I gladly accepted the invitation.</p>
            <p> Description of the journey: On the fixed day we reached the Kamalapur station at 7 a.m. The station was
                very crowded. Somehow we managed to buy our tickets. With great difficulty we got into the train. After
                a few minutes the guard blew the whistle and the train began to move on. I heaved a sigh of relief. A
                gentle breeze entered the compartment. I felt fresh and cold. This helped my mind to enjoy the whole
                journey.</p>
